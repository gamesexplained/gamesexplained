# Load 15 — verified technical facts

The resident draw loop at `$6D41–$6D63` ran 200 iterations in the first 200 frames after this forced load returned. Its four indexed reads use `$81CF`, `$82CF`, `$83CF` and `$84CF` to place a metatile's four character codes in a two-by-two block. The resident movement checks use the indexed attribute table at `$80CF`; the exact meanings of all its bit combinations remain open. This observation follows a forced transition and does not establish a route by ordinary play.

The entry snapshot has 15 row pointers in split tables at `$85CF` and `$8620`. They point to rows beginning at `$8671` and spaced 123 bytes apart; the address immediately after that storage is `$8DA6`, the character-data pointer recorded at `$7F41`. The downward scroll check uses `$7F4C` as its vertical boundary. This does not establish that every stored cell is encountered during play.

The captured sound pointers select voice lists at $A2B1, $A2B9, $A2C1; their records name 6 distinct event patterns. In the captured selector-1 loop, the resident sequencer selected each pattern and reached its documented zero marker in the listing-based simulator. `test_stage_sound_patterns.js` checks the pointers, pattern boundaries and those visits. This observation does not establish when ordinary play selects the sound.

The captured descriptor names 2 six-byte trigger records at `$94D2` and 1 sixteen-byte stage object records at `$9501`. `$7979` copies the trigger fields; `$4655` returns before reading the object pointer if its count is zero, otherwise it copies the fields and calls the map updater. `test_stage_records.js` checks the copies and descriptions, stubbing the map updater for the sixteen-byte records. These captured records do not establish that ordinary play activates them.

The loaded pointer at `$7F3F/$7F40` targets `$94B6`, inside the eight-page character-copy source at `$8DA6`. The entry was observed in the 200-frame forced-play probe and monitor collection. The code and graphics uses overlap; `codemap.json` records only observed instruction starts in that source whose bytes still matched the load-entry snapshot.
