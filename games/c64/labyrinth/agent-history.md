# Labyrinth — agent history

## 17 October 2026 — Bronze, unorig and gpt-6.1-sol

The contributor chose Bronze, allowed web research, confirmed the unorig noreply identity, and reserved opening the pull request. One agent did the work. The branch began at origin/main 60752da; the existing skate-or-die branch was left alone.

VICE 3.13.2 passed 57/57 checks. The first disassembler smoke-test command named the temporary emulator-test snapshot after the check had removed it; the resulting missing-file error was fixed by using an existing smoke-test snapshot. The actual opening snapshot subsequently loaded and answered correctly. No software was downloaded or installed.

The original G64 loader reached the logo, save-slot selector, and text adventure. Character answers were EUAN, M, BLUE. A snapshot was saved before the first command. GO HOME proved the state was interactive. A frame capture took several minutes through the local transport, so it was allowed to finish before sending further input. It exposed the full vector chain and the font in RAM under I/O. An initial font render at $C000 showed shapes rather than the letters; checking $D018 correctly placed the font at $D000. The incorrect image was replaced in place. The sweep was extended to lowercase ASCII after the first PETSCII/screen-code pass found only fragments.

The disassembler was seeded from the IRQ vector. Two decimal entry arguments were corrected against the byte dump; $1131-$1139 was restored to undefined, and $113A was decoded from the live frame’s vector. The high-memory $DE12 target was checked against its caller before being counted as executable RAM. Its caller explicitly banks I/O out. The mechanical census was corrected to count absolute/indexed memory operands only, excluding a relative branch within that high-memory routine.

A documented normal-command route reached the cinema and the graphical gate image. Fire, Space, and Return led through further black/loading intervals, but the interactive maze was not established. The Bronze contribution retains the reproducible text-opening snapshot and lists the graphical continuation as unanalysed. No loader patch, memory POKE, or alternate game image was used.

The run stopped at the requested Bronze boundary: initial sweeps and a partial listing, with no full coverage loop or independent verification sample. The page copy was written after the facts and then revised for the house style. No kit change or lesson file was needed; the relevant rules already covered the mistakes encountered.
