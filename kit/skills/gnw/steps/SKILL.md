description: Which of the kit's tools each core step uses on the Game & Watch: the snapshot, the ROM set, the control file in place of a disassembler, the register census, the references search, the processor's idioms, the simulator, the whole machine, the lockstep, the screen, the sound, the checker's fixes and the page's scripts.

# The core steps on the Game & Watch

The core skills (`kit/skills/core/`) say what each step needs and name a
row of this table where a tool does it; this says which tool does it on
the Game & Watch. The machine's facts are in `gnw-reference`, the server
in `tool-gnw-server` and MAME in `tool-mame`. The machine the kit drives
is its own model of the Sharp SM5A, `kit/gnw/sm5a.js`, held to MAME's
instruction for instruction (`kit/gnw/test_machine.js`); MAME is the
second machine, and the one to play the game on with its screen and
sound. Every script prints its usage with `-h`, and every JavaScript
file's header is its manual. A row marked "none yet" names what to do
until a run on this platform builds the tool.

| Row | Core step | On the Game & Watch |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot` | `10-orient`, `50-coverage`: the image everything is read from | a `.gnw.json.gz`, saved by the server (`tool-gnw-server`, "Snapshots") and read by `kit/gnw/snapshot.py`: the ROM in the order the chip runs it at $0000-$073F, and the data cells at $1000-$107F. The snapshot holds the ROM, so it stays in `work/` |
| `media` | `10-orient`, step 7: what the image holds | MAME's ROM set, a zip of the chip's ROM (1,856 bytes on an SM5A) and an SVG of the screen; the server reads the ROM from the zip itself. MAME's driver block for the unit (`gnw-reference`, "Where to read about a game first") gives the model number, the buttons' wiring and the checksum |
| `disassembler` | `10-orient`, step 6; `50-coverage`, the loop | none live: the annotations are a control file, `work/<slug>.ctl`, written and read (`kit/gnw/project.py` lists its directives), and `symbols_export.py <game> --project work/<slug>.ctl` exports it. `python3 kit/cpu/sm5a.py <rom>` prints the ROM in running order, a line per instruction with its `CB:PM:PL`, as MAME's debugger writes it. `50-coverage`, "When the disassembler does not follow control flow", applies: nothing follows the jumps for you, so type each page from the jumps into it |
| `census` | `40-sweep`, the register census | none yet: the chip reaches its pins by instruction, not by address. Count the instructions instead: `KTA` (buttons), `ATR` (buzzer and button rows), `TA` and `TB` (left and right), `WR`, `WS`, `DTW`, `PDTW`, `TW` and `PTW` (the screen), `TG` (the clock), `DTA` (the divider), `CEND` (sleep), with `grep` on the output of `kit/cpu/sm5a.py` |
| `references` | `50-coverage`, step 2; `60-verify`, "Negative results" | `grep` on the output of `kit/cpu/sm5a.py`: a jump's operand is a step on its page, so search for the step (`TR $1E`) and check the page, and for `TRS` the entry on page $10. A data cell is reached by `LB`, `LBL` and the row moves of `EXC`, `EXCI`, `EXCD` and `LDA`: search for every way B can be set to the cell's row and column, not only `LBL` (`gnw-reference`, "The data memory") |
| `cpu` | `50-coverage`, inline arguments and jump tables | the Sharp SM5A: `gnw-reference`, "The chip" to "Arithmetic". A table of values is a run of `LAX` jumped into part way, and a jump table a run of `TR` |
| `simulator` | `60-verify`; `70-minisite`, a widget's test | `kit/gnw/sm5a.js` bare, `new SM5A(rom)`, with `hooks[pc]` on a physical program counter. It is the whole chip: no hook is needed for the pins, which are its fields (`rows`, `always`, `alpha`, `beta`, `rOut`, `o`, `ox`) |
| `machine` | `60-verify`, "Unreachable"; `70-minisite`, Play | `kit/gnw/sm5a.js`, which is the whole machine: there is nothing on the board but the chip, the LCD, the buzzer and the buttons. The server runs it live (`tool-gnw-server`) |
| `lockstep` | `70-minisite`, Play (`play.md`) | none yet. A pass is one turn of the game's main loop: put a checkpoint on its first instruction and step the port and the chip a pass at a time, comparing the data cells. There is no interrupt to stand in for; the 1 Hz flag and the divider are the chip's own (`gnw-reference`, "Time"), and a port reads them from the machine it runs beside. The first game's run builds `kit/gnw/lockstep.js` |
| `frame` | `10-orient`, step 3; `70-minisite`, "One frame, rebuilt from memory" | the server's `screen` gives the lit segments as MAME's `o.b.h` names; `site/lib/gnw.js`, `GNW.draw`, draws them on the unit's SVG. MAME's own picture, `tools.py mame <set.zip>` and its snapshot key, is the check. Which segment is which object is the game's to find, by lighting one bit at a time |
| `sound` | `70-minisite`, "The sound" | none yet: the buzzer is R1, toggled by `ATR` in a timed loop (`gnw-reference`, "The buzzer"). `kit/gnw/sm5a.js` calls `onBuzzer(level, clocks)` at each change, which is the sound as a list of edges; a player that turns the edges into a tone is the first game's to write |
| `fixes` | `60-verify`, the checker's corrections | apply each correction to the control file by hand and export again: the file is the source of the symbols, as SkoolKit's is on the Spectrum |
| `page` | `70-minisite`, "Building it" | `site/lib/gnw.js` (`GNW.draw`, and `GNWMap` for the footprint), with `lib/sm5a.js`, the kit's machine served beside it, for a widget that runs the chip. A page carries the screen's segments it draws as data |
