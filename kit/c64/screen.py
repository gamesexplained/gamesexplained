"""What the screen says, as lines of text: for a script that waits on a prompt.

A script that drives a game through its prompts (a copier, a menu, a disk swap) has to know what
the screen says, and a screenshot tells an agent but not a script. This reads it from the video
chip's registers and the memory they point at:

  text mode     the screen codes, through the character ROM's two sets: letters, digits and
                punctuation as themselves, the lower-case set where $D018 picks it, a reversed
                character as the plain one, and each graphic character as GRAPHIC
  bitmap mode   the game's own font, which the caller names: each glyph is looked for in the
                bitmap as the font has it and inverted (EOR $FF). Many disk games draw all their
                text this way, role-playing and adventure games above all

  from screen import Font, text, wait_text
  lines = text(rpc)                                  # 25 lines, trailing spaces cut
  font = Font(0xC600, first=0x20)                    # glyph c at $C600 + (c - $20) * 8
  lines = text(rpc, font)
  m = wait_text(rpc, r"Insert (master|copy)", font, timeout=60)     # a re.Match

A font is eight bytes a glyph, from address (read through bank, "ram" unless it is a ROM's), and
the character code of its first glyph: first=0x20 for a font in ASCII order from the space. A
font in another order names its glyphs instead, one character each: chars=ROM_UPPER for one laid
out like the character ROM. width is how far apart the game draws two letters, which is not how
wide a letter looks:
  8      each glyph is copied whole into one of the bitmap's cells, as most games do, even when
         its letters are six pixels wide: the cells are read one by one
  1-7    letters packed closer than the cells, at any pixel: the leftmost width pixels of each
         glyph's bytes are looked for at every pixel of every line. A glyph with a pixel right
         of them is refused, since the width is then wrong; a line is placed on the screen's
         row nearest it, and a gap of a letter's width or more reads as spaces
A text-mode game whose character set does not keep the letters at the ROM's screen codes reads
the same way, through its font.

The registers are read once, at the start of each read. A screen split by raster interrupts
into a picture and a text window reads as whichever half they hold at that moment (frame.py
records a whole frame), and a read of a running machine can catch a line half drawn.

Usage:
  screen.py                                 print the running machine's screen
  screen.py --font '$C600' [--width 6] [--first '$20'] [--count 95] [--bank rom]
                                            read it through the game's font
  screen.py --wait 'PATTERN' [--timeout 30] [--font ...]
                                            wait until the screen matches, then print it;
                                            exit 1 if it does not, or if the machine is stopped
