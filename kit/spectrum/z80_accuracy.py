"""Measure ZEsarUX's Z80 against public test programs, and print what each one said.

    python3 kit/scripts/tools.py --platform spectrum zesarux        (start it first)
    python3 kit/scripts/tools.py --platform spectrum z80-accuracy
    python3 kit/spectrum/z80_accuracy.py [--program NAME] [--timeout SECONDS] [--no-fetch]

Each program is a 48K `.tap` that loads itself, runs and prints its own verdict on the
Spectrum's screen, so this needs no game and no snapshot of ours. The script plays the
tape through ZRCP (`smartload`), reads the machine's screen ten times a second
until the program's own last line appears, and prints PASS, FAIL or UNKNOWN with that
line as it stands. Nothing is judged by wall clock: PASS is the words the program
printed, and a program that does not reach its last line in `--timeout` seconds is
UNKNOWN, which is what it is. What is on screen apart from that line goes to
`tools/logs/z80-accuracy/`: every distinct screen line the polls saw, the last screen
whole, and the `.tap`'s URL, licence and sha256, per program.

The programs, and who they belong to. **None of it is vendored.** The first run
downloads each project's file into the gitignored `tools/z80-accuracy/`, naming the
URL, the licence and the size before it does; `--no-fetch` refuses to download, and
then only the programs already there can run.

  z80full, z80doc, z80flags, z80memptr, z80ccf
      Patrik Rak's z80test 1.2a — the release's own prebuilt 48K `.tap`s, MIT licence,
      `github.com/raxoft/z80test`. Its CRCs were computed by a real Zilog Z80 in a 48K
      Spectrum, so a mismatch is a difference from that part, not from a specification.
      Two of the release's files are not run here: `z80docflags` (z80doc with only the
      documented flags checked) and `z80ccfscr`, which is a visual test — it draws which
      CPU variant it emulates and prints no pass or fail at all.
  zexdoc, zexall
      Frank Cringle's Z80 instruction exerciser, the CP/M `ZEXDOC`/`ZEXALL`, as the 48K
      `.tap` conversion by J.G.Harston and Stuart Brady, GPL-2.0-or-later. This is the
      one download from outside its own project: the exerciser itself ships CP/M `.COM`
      files and Z80 sources, and the Spectrum form is a third party's, which the URL in
      the output says plainly. One line per instruction, ending `Tests complete`; it
      never returns to BASIC (it ends in `jp stop`), so the final screen is the
      observable and this script resets the machine when it is done.
  FUSE's Z80 core tests
      Not runnable here, and not attempted. They are a host program (`z80/coretest.c`,
      `z80/tests/tests.in`, `z80/tests/tests.expected`) linked against FUSE's own CPU
      core: there is no `.tap`, no release asset, no way to build a Spectrum program out
      of them, and what they exercise is FUSE's core, not the CPU of the machine under
      test. `kit/spectrum/INSTALL.md` records that beside the row, and the script prints
      it rather than pretending otherwise.

What it reads, and what it does not. Each program prints far more than the 24 lines the
screen holds, so the lines are accumulated as the polls see them and the count the
program itself reported is the one to trust; when the two disagree the run says so. The
screen is decoded out of the machine's memory, not taken from ZRCP's `get-ocr`, which
keeps serving the last screen it drew even after a reset, and it is emptied before every
run for the same reason.
A full screen makes the ROM ask `scroll?` and wait for a key, which is the one thing a
program cannot do for itself here, so the script presses ENTER (holding it 0.3 s, then
releasing it: the ROM wants a press it can see) and counts the presses in the log.
ZEsarUX is never started from here — the launcher does that (AGENTS.md, "Leave the
cleanest footprint you can"); `KIT_ZESARUX_PORT` picks a second machine, as
`kit/spectrum/zesarux.py` documents.

Run it after installing, and again after any new release or build: it is the CPU half
of `check-emulator`'s picture, which measures the machine's interface rather than its
arithmetic.
